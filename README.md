# spacebook

A project for FIXD

# Changes I would make if I had more time
- Utilize generics for the Activity model to minimize duplication in SpacebookApi class
- Try to remove redundancy of when() statements when getting the type of Activity
- Potentially add network calls to get the names/rating/etc for more in depth info for the feed and the post page (this may not be worth it)
- find or create a library to show rating in stars/circles/etc
- make some better looking screens
- Add true dependency injection (whether it be Hilt or Dagger)
- Add better error handling and display more info to the user when something fails
- Add unit tests
